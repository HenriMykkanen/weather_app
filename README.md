# weather_app

A simple weather App created using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and using an API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://www.weatherapi.com/)https://www.weatherapi.com/.
Purpose of the project was to learn the basics of Riverpod State Management, attempt to have a decent folder structure/architecture and get some experience communicating with an external API.
